		<h2>If you are here, you must know game called "SkyRail" if you need guide for other games, scroll down. So, how to play the game? You have extremely big choice, but, i can't use some trains, and some used for ad! What is that! Don't worry, you just need to have 50+ km to unlock some trains, also some trains are using 100+ and more, you understand? Ok! How to get SkyCoins? It's easy you just need to stop nice and smooth, then you will get 10-20 coins, with them you can buy skins and items, on 03.02.2023 there is only 4 items, tea, ticket, phone and laptop and there is a lot of skins, don't worry, you can also buy them for real money! If your game lags, just change graphics it in settings! Also there is a dlc, so now, you can play SkyRail!<h2/>
